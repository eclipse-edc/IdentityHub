# Decentralized Claims Protocol Architecture

The EDC IdentityHub fully implements the Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP) architecture, which is designed to
facilitate the secure and private exchange of identity claims between parties.

IdentityHub contains code for both the holder side and the issuer side of the DCP architecture. The holder side is
responsible for requesting, storing and presenting Verifiable Credentials, while the issuer side is responsible for
issuing Verifiable Credentials to holders according to a pre-arranged definition scheme.

## Disclaimer

It should be noted that some components of this architecture, specifically dealing with credential issuance, are still
undergoing active development and should **NOT** be used in production scenarios and should **NOT** be considered
stable.
